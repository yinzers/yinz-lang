# Audit trail — 2026-07-04-v0-3-m7-optimizer-pipeline

Append-only. *How the plan got here.* Read by the AAR, auditors, and the execution conductor's
Step-3a / Step-0 reconcile; never by executors (they read the current-truth plan.md slice).

## Session log

- `plan-author-2026-07-04-m7-optimizer` — 2026-07-04 — Authored the original OPORD draft (¶1–¶5,
  9 phases, risk table R1–R6, Future Requirements, Roadmap Reconciliation). No `audit.md` was created
  at this time (plan had not yet been dispatched for execution).
- `plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-blockers` — 2026-07-04 — Pre-execution amendment pass resolving all
  plan-reviewer findings (this plan has not started Phase 0; no phase has been dispatched, so no
  FRAGO delta-record applies — these are authoring-time corrections to the still-unexecuted OPORD,
  recorded here as a session-log entry per the amendment discipline). Changes:
  - Authored the missing `## Invariants This Milestone Must Preserve` section (all 7 subsections:
    Safety, Performance, Teaching, Runtime Dependencies, Kernel-Mode Behavior, Demo & Error Gallery,
    Feature Registry Entries), placed after ¶3.4 Coordinating Instructions and before ¶4 Sustainment
    (M5-plan precedent placement).
  - Authored the missing `## Design-Doc Alignment` section (citing `IMP-no-function-coloring.md`'s
    "Scheduler Preemption Model" section and `authoritative-derivation.md`, with citation-depth
    verification, divergence enumeration, and the M6/M7 milestone-boundary flag for P4-1), placed
    after ¶1 Risk Assessment and before ¶2 Mission (M5-plan precedent placement).
  - Fixed the false spike-evidence claim: the cited worktree
    (`.claude/worktrees/agent-abba2c8babbd9ea21`) is gitignored, uncommitted, lives in a different
    clone, and its branch was reused — it no longer preserves anything. Created a checked-in unified
    diff, `spike-o0-flip.patch` (this directory), reconstructed and byte-verified against the current
    tree's `crates/ynz-codegen/src/emit.rs:876-882` and `crates/ynz-codegen/src/state_machine.rs:752-758`.
    Rewrote every plan reference (¶1 Terrain, ¶4 Sustainment "Reference artifact," Phase 1 Step 2) to
    cite `spike-o0-flip.patch` as the preserved mechanism-reproduction artifact and
    `.claude/audits/2026-07-04-concurrency-release-audit.md`'s "Phase-0 spike" section as the primary
    durable evidence of the spike's RED verdict (6/470 failures, failing-fixture list, direct-repro
    SIGSEGV). Grep-confirmed zero remaining `abba2c8babbd9ea21` references in `plan.md`.
  - Resolved the Phase 3/4 ordering contradiction: hard-sequenced Phase 3 → Phase 4 (was
    "either order"). Updated ¶3.2 Concept (added an explicit Ordering note + rewrote the phase-summary
    sentence), ¶3.4 Coordinating Instructions' Sequencing bullet, and Phase 4's Task+purpose text to
    state the hard sequence and its reason (Phase 4 Step 1 re-confirms the crash under Phase 3's
    now-live pipeline). Grep-confirmed zero remaining "either order" references.
  - Added `**CHECKPOINT**` marks to Phase 6 (6 steps trips the >5-step trigger; added after step 2 and
    after step 4, splitting into 2/2/2-step segments) and annotated its Model tag.
  - Re-nested every existing `**CHECKPOINT**` mark (Phases 1, 2, 3, 5, 7) from its own numbered list
    item into a standalone line nested under the preceding step, per
    `REF-plan-format.md`'s checkpoint-mark syntax — renumbered the now-shorter Steps lists in each of
    those phases accordingly.
  - Added risk row R7 (optimizer/golden non-determinism breaking the Phase 5 byte-identical 2-run
    gate) to the ¶1 risk table: C×III initial MEDIUM, mitigated by the Phase 5 two-independent-run
    gate itself (B2, probability, −1) → residual LOW (D×III), per REF-risk-engine.md.
  - Named both duplicate roadmap `## Capability Ledger` tables explicitly (roadmap.md lines ~365 and
    ~417) in Phase 8 Step 2 and the `## Roadmap Reconciliation` section intro, and required both be
    updated in lockstep (matching the sibling M6 plan's independent commitment to the same
    both-tables convention).
  - Rewrote the frontmatter-deviation blockquote to state the real convention: `paused` is the
    conductor-set pre-approval state (Gate 4 pending + the M6-merge precondition), removing the
    prior self-contradictory "should be active per charter" framing.
  - Added a "Civil considerations" line to the ¶1 cross-cutting factor sweep: N/A — compiler-internal
    backend work, no user-facing surface change.
  - Appended `session-id: "plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-blockers"` to the frontmatter chain
    (append-only — `plan-author-2026-07-04-m7-optimizer` preserved).

- `plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-links` — 2026-07-04 — Mechanical amendment pass, no execution has started
  (pre-Phase-0). Fixed two classes of citation defects: (1) R7's mitigation-proof citation said "Phase 5
  step 4" for the golden second-regeneration work; verified against Phase 5's actual step list and
  corrected to "step 3" (the second-independent-run diff is Phase 5 Step 3, not Step 4). (2) Every
  broken relative-link depth in the file: 8 `IMP-no-function-coloring.md` links using a wrong 5-up form
  (lines 221, 344, 471, 479, 494, 499, 608, 798 — 608 found during the mechanical sweep, not in the
  original enumerated list) corrected to the 4-up form already used at lines 142/664; 3
  `authoritative-derivation.md` links using a wrong 4-up form missing the `.claude` segment (lines 95,
  343, 609) corrected to the 3-up form used at 144/154; 4 links to `Cargo.toml`/`ci.yml`/`features.toml`
  using a wrong 5-up form (lines 37, 68, 573, 741) corrected to 4-up; Phase 8 Step 1's `roadmap.md`
  citation (line 554) missing the `active/` segment, corrected to
  `../../active/2026-05-21-v0-3-concurrency-perf/roadmap.md`. Every one of the corrected targets
  re-verified to exist on disk at its new relative path after the edit. Links to global `~/.claude`
  specs (`REF-plan-format.md`, `REF-risk-engine.md`, `plan-source-of-truth.md`,
  `plan-spike-discipline.md`) were deliberately left untouched — a recorded systemic
  global-vs-project-link convention gap out of this plan's scope. Appended
  `session-id: "plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-links"` to the frontmatter chain (append-only).

- `plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-phase6-yield` — 2026-07-04 — Pre-execution amendment pass (no phase
  dispatched; still `paused`, pre-Phase-0), triggered by Fable's personal plan-audit finding recorded
  in [`.claude/audits/2026-07-04-concurrency-release-audit.md`](../../../audits/2026-07-04-concurrency-release-audit.md)
  "M7-plan addendum": Phase 6's original framing ("implement real cooperative-yield semantics inside
  `ynz_rt_check_preempt`") was architecturally wrong — a synchronous `extern "C"` callee cannot yield
  the enclosing Tokio task by itself. Verified directly against the code before amending: `runtime.rs:281-299`
  (`ynz_rt_check_preempt` is a synchronous no-op stub), `emit.rs:12356-12365` (`emit_loop_preempt`
  emits a plain, unconditional call at loop back edges), and `state_machine.rs` (the existing
  authoritative suspension machinery — `store_resume_point`/`load_resume_point`,
  `flush_var_slot_to_frame` in `emit.rs` — that a resume function already uses to store `resume_point`
  and return `Pending` at `wait` points). Changes:
  - Rewrote Phase 6's Task+purpose and all 6 Steps into 7 steps: (1) a new DESIGN step specifying the
    codegen back-edge poll-yield transform (which loops qualify — SM functions only; what the yield
    emits — `resume_point` store + crossing-local flush via the EXISTING authoritative suspension
    machinery, reuse not re-derivation, per [`authoritative-derivation.md`](../../../rules/authoritative-derivation.md);
    the budget-check mechanism — `ynz_rt_check_preempt` becomes a cheap synchronous CHECK, never the
    yield itself; and the explicit non-SM residual), (2) implement the codegen transform + the check
    fn, (3) the starvation-proof fixture set — now requiring BOTH an SM-positive fixture (hot loop
    inside a wait-containing function) AND a companion non-SM-residual fixture (identical hot loop
    inside a plain function, confirmed NOT preempted, relying on existing CPU-admission routing) — then
    the pre-existing pre-register-threshold / call-site-measurement / decision / doc-update steps,
    renumbered 4–7. Added `**CHECKPOINT**` marks after Steps 1, 3, and 5 (was after Steps 2 and 4;
    re-anchored to the new step positions). Raised the Model tag from `(coding, standard, medium)` to
    `(coding, high, medium)` — quality-bar raised to match Phase 1/2's bar for the same
    silent-miscompile hazard family. Added an adversarial-gate-checker reviewer clause specific to R8
    (does the RED-fixture set prove frame-layout correctness; does the transform genuinely reuse the
    authoritative machinery rather than re-deriving a parallel one).
  - Added risk row **R8** to the ¶1 Risk Assessment table (back-edge poll-yield codegen transform → new
    frame-layout/crossing-local suspension hazard, same silent-miscompile family as R1 and this repo's
    four-milestone twin-derivation/frame history: M3a/M3d/M3e/M3g). Scored per REF-risk-engine.md:
    initial `lookup(B, II) = HIGH`. Applied the one honestly-provable catalog mitigation — Adversarial/
    RED-repro test (B2, probability, −1; proof: loop-crossing-local suspension fixtures authored and
    committed BEFORE the transform lands) — shifting probability B→C. Re-lookup(C, II) = **HIGH,
    unchanged** (Critical severity does not clear High until probability reaches D). Explicitly
    evaluated and REJECTED two candidate second mitigations as dishonest catalog stretches: (a)
    severity-axis B1 patterns (made-reversible/idempotency) don't map to a compiler miscompile, and
    this plan's severity-anchor selection already prices git-revertibility into Sev II — re-applying it
    would double-count the same fact; (b) canary/staged-exposure's precondition presumes staged
    PRODUCTION exposure, which doesn't exist for compiler-internal pre-release work. Residual: **HIGH**.
    Drafted the RISK OVERRIDE block in place (¶1, immediately below the risk table) with the signature
    line deliberately left blank — this producer never self-signs a HIGH residual; the
    orchestrator/Patrick's signature is required before Phase 6 Step 2 (implementation) begins.
  - Sibling-swept the whole plan for "check_preempt", "back-edge", "yield", "preempt" and reconciled
    every hit with the corrected architecture: Design-Doc Alignment divergence 1 (added the
    architectural-gap clarification + the three-part TRUE-architecture framing), Key Outcome 3
    (rewrote to state preemption is currently ZERO today, not "already partially true," and the
    three-part architecture), the Teaching invariant (three-part doc-rewrite framing), the Runtime
    Dependencies invariant (codegen-transform-not-runtime-magic framing + the named non-SM residual),
    the Kernel-Mode Behavior invariant (added the non-SM-residual kernel-orthogonality clause), and the
    R6 risk row (added a one-line clause distinguishing R6's overhead concern from R8's
    frame-layout-correctness concern — both are codegen-emitted poll-yield sites, never runtime magic).
    Fixed a stale cross-reference in `### Feature Registry Entries` ("Phase 6 step 5" → "Phase 6 step
    6" — the decision step's position shifted when the new Step 1/Step 3 were inserted).
  - Added Future Requirements / Revisit **#8** — the named non-SM-admission-miss residual, as its own
    tracked four-field entry (WHAT/WHY/COST/TRIGGER), since it is a genuinely new named limitation this
    amendment introduces and REF-plan-format.md's doctrine requires every unresolved risk/limitation to
    be an observed future requirement, never a loose note.
  - Appended `session-id: "plan-amend-2026-07-04-m7-phase6-yield"` to the frontmatter chain
    (append-only — all three prior session-ids preserved).

- `gate4-signatures-2026-07-04` — 2026-07-04 — Signature event: Patrick signed R8's RISK OVERRIDE
  (back-edge poll-yield frame-layout hazard, ¶1 Risk Assessment) as part of Gate-4 approval covering
  all three sibling concurrency plans (M6/M7/M8). Filled `Accepted by: Patrick (Gate-4 approval,
  conducted 2026-07-04)` and `Date: 2026-07-04` on the previously-blank signature lines; no other risk
  text changed. Appended `session-id: "gate4-signatures-2026-07-04"` to the frontmatter chain
  (append-only — all four prior session-ids preserved).

## FRAGO log

(none yet — this plan has not been dispatched for execution; the amendment above is a pre-execution
authoring correction, not an execution-time deviation. The first FRAGO, if any, will be filed once
Phase 0 is dispatched and reality diverges from the written plan.)

## Context-segment log

(none yet — no phase has been dispatched.)
